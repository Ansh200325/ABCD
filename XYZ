            "reviewText": "\"  This model of RCA Tablets has always been my favourite model. I bought one both used and new (recently) and the size, battery-life (on the new one anyway), and overall user-friendly interface is perfect for playing games and light internet browsing. If taken good care of, this little tablet shall be a mainstay for me for at least 1-2 years. Recommended especially for those who dont want to get burned (like I did about a few weeks back) with a tablet with a version of Android that has a Factory Reset Protection feature (FSP) that was previously owned by another user and therefore no way (unless you know the specific former user) of unlocking the tablet for your own use. This particular model (Rca Rct6303W87Dk) does not have FSP and so users will not experience an issue with initial setup. From now on when buying, I will go only by the model number to ensure that wont happen again. But overall, I recommend this tablet for those who are looking for a light-weight, portable internet browsing, gaming tablet. The keyboard is definitely small but good for younger kids and smaller-handed adult as far as typing. I usually just use the touchscreen, which is pretty responsive. You may have to pay a little extra for this particular model as it has become increasingly harder to come by in new or refurbished, like-new condition, but I feel that it has been well worth it.\"",

The battery life is good, with a full charge typically lasting most of the day.  I wont lower the battery rating as I know that playing games is a big drain on battery life.  The only thing keeping this from being a 5-star review is the fact that there are times of lag and apps force quitting.  I realize that this isnt a top of the line unit, and thats fine, but this was bought to replace an older tablet of similar performance that didnt suffer these types of issues.  Overall, it has done its job well.  It has a large screen and a MicroSD slot and he has enjoyed his new tablet.\"",

So I got the Viking. It has a much larger screen so it is easier for me to read, and it seems to have better performance. Battery life is better, too. The keyboard is a nice option for when you need to do some real typing. Though it has a larger screen than I was used to, it is not overly heavy, so its not a problem holding it while web-surfing from an easy chair.\"",
